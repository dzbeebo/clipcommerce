1\. Executive Summary
---------------------

### Overview

ClipCommerce is a two-sided marketplace platform that connects content creators with "clippers" - content creators who specialize in creating and distributing short-form clips from longer-form content. The platform automates the workflow of clip submission, verification, approval, payment processing, and performance analytics.

### Business Model

-   **Revenue Stream 1:** Monthly subscription fees from content creators (tiered pricing)
-   **Revenue Stream 2:** Variable transaction fee on all payouts (configurable in admin panel)
-   **Target Market:** YouTube content creators (MVP), expanding to TikTok/Instagram in future phases

### Key Value Propositions

**For Content Creators:**

-   Automate clipper management and payments
-   Verify clipper ownership to prevent fraud
-   Track ROI and clipper performance
-   Scale clip distribution without manual overhead

**For Clippers:**

-   Discover creator opportunities in one place
-   Automated payment processing
-   Clear performance metrics
-   Build reputation for auto-approval status

* * * * *

2\. Goals & Objectives
----------------------

### Business Goals

1.  **Launch MVP within 90 days** with YouTube-only integration
2.  **Acquire 50 content creators** in first 6 months
3.  **Process $100K+ in clipper payouts** by month 6
4.  **Achieve 90%+ creator retention rate** after 3 months

### Product Goals

1.  Reduce clipper payment processing time from hours to minutes
2.  Eliminate payment fraud through OAuth verification
3.  Provide real-time analytics for creator decision-making
4.  Enable auto-approval workflow to reduce creator workload by 70%

### Success Metrics (KPIs)

-   **Activation:** % of creators who onboard ‚â•1 clipper within 7 days
-   **Engagement:** Average clips submitted per creator per week
-   **Retention:** 30/60/90-day creator retention rate
-   **Revenue:** MRR, transaction volume, average transaction fee %
-   **Quality:** Clipper approval rate, dispute rate

* * * * *

3\. Target Users & Personas
---------------------------

### Primary Persona: Content Creator (Mike)

-   **Demographics:** 25-40 years old, YouTube creator with 50K-500K subscribers
-   **Behavior:** Posts 2-4 long-form videos per week, aware clippers exist but managing them manually via DMs/spreadsheets
-   **Pain Points:**
    -   Spending 5+ hours/week verifying clips and processing payments
    -   Can't verify if clippers actually own the accounts they claim
    -   No visibility into which clippers drive best ROI
    -   PayPal/Venmo payments are manual and error-prone
-   **Goals:** Scale clip distribution, reduce admin work, pay clippers fairly, prevent fraud

### Secondary Persona: Clipper (Sarah)

-   **Demographics:** 18-30 years old, runs 3-10 short-form content accounts across platforms
-   **Behavior:** Clips content from 5-10 creators, posts 10-30 clips per week
-   **Pain Points:**
    -   Hard to discover creators who pay for clips
    -   Manual payment requests via DM are awkward
    -   No clear metrics on earnings potential
    -   Delayed payments (sometimes 30+ days)
-   **Goals:** Find high-paying creators, get paid quickly, build reputation, maximize earnings

* * * * *

4\. Problem Statement
---------------------

**Current State:**\
Content creators are paying clippers manually through ad-hoc arrangements using PayPal, Venmo, or direct deposit. This process is time-intensive, error-prone, and vulnerable to fraud (clippers claiming ownership of clips they don't own). Creators lack visibility into clipper performance and ROI.

**Desired State:**\
A fully automated platform where clippers submit clips with verified ownership, creators review and approve submissions with data-driven insights, and payments are processed automatically with configurable payout rules.

**Market Opportunity:**\
The clipper economy is exploding with thousands of clippers and hundreds of creators participating, but no dedicated infrastructure exists. Current solutions (spreadsheets, DMs, PayPal) don't scale beyond 5-10 clippers per creator.

5\. Proposed Solution
---------------------

### Core Platform Features

#### **5.1 Unified User Management & Account Creation** ‚≠ê UPDATED

**Key Design Principle:** Users explicitly choose their account type during signup, which determines their entire platform experience, available features, and dashboard.

**Account Types:**

-   **Creator Account:** Access to creator dashboard, community management, submission review, payment settings, analytics
-   **Clipper Account:** Access to clipper dashboard, clip submission, earnings tracking, creator marketplace
-   **Admin Account:** Access to admin panel (created manually, not via public signup)

**Important:** Once an account type is selected, it cannot be changed through the UI (requires admin intervention). This prevents confusion and maintains clear role boundaries.

##### 5.1.1 Unified Signup Flow

```
Landing Page ‚Üí "Get Started" ‚Üí Account Type Selection ‚Üí Role-Specific Signup
```

**User Journey:**
1. User clicks "Get Started" or "Sign Up" on homepage
2. Redirected to `/signup` page
3. Page displays two clear options:
   - **"I'm a Creator"** - "Manage clippers and automate payments"
   - **"I'm a Clipper"** - "Find creators and earn from your clips"
4. User selects account type
5. Redirected to role-specific signup form
6. After account creation, role determines all subsequent features and UI

##### 5.1.2 Role-Based Authentication & Access Control
- All authentication handled through NextAuth.js
- User role stored in User table (enum: CREATOR, CLIPPER, ADMIN)
- Middleware enforces role-based access:
  - `/dashboard/*` ‚Üí Creators only
  - `/clipper/*` ‚Üí Clippers only
  - `/admin/*` ‚Üí Admins only
- Attempting to access wrong dashboard shows 403 error with clear messaging

##### 5.1.3 Role-Specific Onboarding Paths

**Creator Onboarding:**
```
1. Email/password signup
2. Email verification (optional for MVP)
3. Stripe Connect onboarding (for receiving subscription payments & sending payouts)
4. Profile setup (display name, description, avatar, payment rates)
5. Subscription plan selection (Starter/Pro/Enterprise)
6. Creator dashboard (empty state with "Share your profile" CTA)
```

**Clipper Onboarding:**
```
1. Email/password signup
2. Email verification (optional for MVP)
3. YouTube OAuth connection (verify channel ownership)
4. Stripe Connect onboarding (for receiving payouts)
5. Profile setup (display name)
6. Clipper dashboard (empty state with "Browse Creators" CTA)
```

#### **5.2 Creator Profile & Community Management**
- Public creator profile page (discoverable by clippers)
- "Join Community" button for clippers to apply
- Creator dashboard showing all active clippers
- Ability to accept/reject clipper applications
- Creator-only features (not visible to clippers)

#### **5.3 Clipper Submission Workflow**
```
1. Clipper selects creator from "My Communities"
2. Enters YouTube video URL
3. System verifies video ownership via YouTube OAuth
4. System pulls video metadata (title, views, thumbnail, publish date)
5. Clipper submits for review
6. Submission enters creator's review queue
```

#### **5.4 Creator Review & Approval System**

-   Review queue with all pending submissions
-   Video preview with metadata (views, publish date, channel verification)
-   Manual approve/reject buttons
-   Bulk actions (approve all, reject all)
-   Auto-approval toggle per clipper (based on reputation)
-   Notes/comments field for rejection reasons

#### **5.5 Payment Rate Configuration** (Creator-only)

-   Creator sets: `$X per Y views` (e.g., $20 per 1,000 views)
-   Payout mode toggle:
    -   **One-time:** Pay once upon approval based on current views
    -   **Recurring:** Pay incrementally as views accumulate (track paid vs unpaid views)
-   Minimum payout threshold (e.g., $10 minimum per transaction)

#### **5.6 Automated Payment Processing**

-   Upon approval, system calculates payment: `(current_views / rate_views) * rate_amount`
-   For recurring mode: `(new_views_since_last_payout / rate_views) * rate_amount`
-   System deducts platform commission (configurable in admin)
-   Stripe Connect transfer from creator to clipper
-   Payment confirmation email to both parties
-   Transaction history log

#### **5.7 Analytics Dashboard (Creator-only)**

-   **Overview:**
    -   Total paid out (all-time, this month)
    -   Total clips tracked
    -   Total views generated
    -   ROI calculation: `(total_views * estimated_CPM) / total_paid`

    -   Top clippers by total views
    -   Top clippers by total earnings
    -   Approval rate per clipper
-   **Performance Charts:**
    -   Views over time (line chart)

    -   Earnings per clip
-   **Creator Marketplace:**

-   User management (view all creators/clippers, suspend accounts)
-   Transaction history (all platform payments)
-   System health metrics (API call success rates, failed payments)
-   Feature flags for beta features

## 13. Success Metrics & KPIs (Unchanged from v1.0)

*(Metrics remain the same)*

---

## 14. Risk Assessment & Mitigation (Unchanged from v1.0)

*(Risks remain the same)*

---

## 15. Go-to-Market Strategy (Unchanged from v1.0)

*(GTM strategy remains the same)*

---

## 16. Assumptions & Open Questions (UPDATED)

### Critical Assumptions (Need Validation)

1. **Assumption:** Users will clearly understand the difference between Creator and Clipper accounts at signup
   - **Validation Method:** User testing on signup flow, track signup completion rates by account type
   - **Risk if Wrong:** Users create wrong account type, requires support to fix or account migration feature

2. **Assumption:** Separate dashboards for each role won't confuse users who might want both perspectives
   - **Validation Method:** Beta user interviews, track 403 error frequency
   - **Risk if Wrong:** May need to allow users to have both roles (requires significant schema changes)

3. **Assumption:** Role-based access control at signup is sufficient (no need to switch roles later)
   - **Validation Method:** Support ticket analysis, user feedback
   - **Risk if Wrong:** May need admin tool to change user roles or migration flow

4-7. *(Same as v1.0)*

---

### Open Questions (Need Research)

1. **UX:** Should we allow users to create both Creator AND Clipper accounts with same email?
   - **Current Decision:** No - one email = one role
   - **Alternative:** Allow dual roles with account switching
   - **Action:** Validate in beta, assess demand
   - **Timeline:** Month 2

2. **Security:** How do we prevent users from gaming the system by creating both account types?
   - **Action:** Implement fraud detection (same payment method, same IP, etc.)
   - **Timeline:** Before public launch

3. **Onboarding:** Should onboarding be skippable with "Complete Later" option?
   - **Current Decision:** No - must complete to access features
   - **Risk:** Higher drop-off during onboarding
   - **Action:** A/B test in beta
   - **Timeline:** Week 6-8

4. **Roles:** Will we ever need more granular roles (e.g., Agency, Manager, Team Member)?
   - **Current Decision:** Not for MVP
   - **Action:** Design database schema to allow role expansion
   - **Timeline:** Phase 3

5-6. *(Same as v1.0)*

### Developer Agent Handoff Checklist

When ready to begin development with an AI agent, provide:

‚úÖ **This updated PRD v1.1** (with role-based account creation)
‚úÖ **GitHub repo link**
‚úÖ **API credentials:**
   - Google Cloud Console project
   - Stripe API keys (test mode)
   - Database connection string
‚úÖ **Prioritized feature list:** Start with Week 1 (account creation system)
‚úÖ **Design references:** Wireframes for signup flow

**Suggested First Prompt to Developer Agent:**
```
I need you to build ClipCommerce MVP with role-based account creation.

Key Requirements:
1. Users choose between Creator or Clipper account at signup
2. Completely separate dashboards for each role (/dashboard for creators, /clipper for clippers)
3. Role-based access control enforced by middleware
4. Each role has different onboarding flow

Tech Stack:
- Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript
- PostgreSQL (Neon) + Prisma ORM
- NextAuth.js for auth with role-based sessions
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui

Let's start with:
1. Setting up the updated Prisma schema with User.role enum
2. Creating the unified signup page (/signup) with account type selection
3. Implementing separate signup forms for creators and clippers
4. Setting up role-based middleware for route protection

Here's the Prisma schema... [paste schema from this PRD]
